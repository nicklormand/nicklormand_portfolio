Hello! I'm Nick, a Technical Director at DreamWorks Animation. 
I've been working in the animation industry for about 4 years, 
and I've been lucky enough to work on some amazing projects. In my portfolio,
you can find some of the work I've done over the years from Dreamworks as well
as some personal projects I've worked on going back to my time at the University
Texas at Dallas. Find more about me on the [about](/about) page.
