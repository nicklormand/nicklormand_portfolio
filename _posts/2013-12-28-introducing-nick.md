I started my career at DreamWorks Animation as a Technical Resource Administrator, or render wrangler for short, in 2021. The year after that in 2022, I moved on to become a Department Technical Director, working in pipeline development as well as short and feature animation support. 

I've worked in production on such films as Trolls Band Together, Kung Fu Panda 4, The Wildroboot, and supported others as a render wrangler such as The Bad Guys, Boss Baby 2, and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.   My start in Animation/VFX was mostly compositing and motion tracking.  I have a Bachelor of Arts in Arts, Technology, and Emerging Communication with a minor in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Dallas. (Go Comets!)

I've developed tools for third-party programs such as Maya and Houdini and proprietary programs at DreamWorks such as Premo.  Languages I've used have been Python (with PyQt/PySide), C/C++, Javascript, and USD.
